		"desc" => "Released in 1967 and now recognized as one of the finest and most haunting albums to come out of the Summer of Love. Inarguably Love's masterpiece and an album of enduring beauty, but it's also one of the few major works of its era that saw the dark clouds looming on the cultural horizon, and the result was music that was as prescient as it was compelling.",

		"desc" => "The album that essentially kick-started the U.K. glam rock craze, Electric Warrior completes T. Rex's transformation from hippie folk-rockers into flamboyant avatars of trashy rock & roll. The real reason Electric Warrior stands the test of time so well -- despite its intended disposability -- is that it revels so freely in its own absurdity and willful lack of substance.",

		"pic" => "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ed/The-Queen-is-Dead-cover.png",
		"desc" => "The “imperial phase” is a nifty concept coined by Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys that describes the point in a pop performer’s career arc when they can do no wrong—that Midas-touch stretch when creative risks and commercial heights keep peaking. Signaled by its aptly regal name, The Queen Is Dead is when the Smiths crest into their own imperial moment. For believers, the release of The Queen Is Dead in June 1986 proved that the Smiths were the greatest group in the world.",

		"year" => 1971,
		"price" => 17,
		"pic" => "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/David_Bowie_-_Hunky_Dory.jpg",
		"desc" => "Hunky Dory is a kaleidoscopic array of pop styles, tied together only by Bowie's sense of vision: a sweeping, cinematic mélange of high and low art, ambiguous sexuality, kitsch, and class. On the surface, such a wide range of styles and sounds would make an album incoherent, but Bowie's improved songwriting and determined sense of style instead made Hunky Dory a touchstone for reinterpreting pop's traditions into fresh, postmodern pop music.",

		"title" => "Songs in the Key of Life",
		"year" => 1976,
		"price" => 30,
		"pic" => "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e2/Songs_in_the_key_of_life.jpg",
		"desc" => "Songs in the Key of Life was Stevie Wonder's longest, most ambitious collection of songs, a two-LP (plus accompanying EP) set that -- just as the title promised -- touched on nearly every issue under the sun, and did it all with ambitious (even for him), wide-ranging arrangements and some of the best performances of Wonder's career. Though they didn't necessarily appear in order, Songs in the Key of Life contains nearly a full album on love and relationships, along with another full album on issues social and spiritual. Stevie Wonder had talent to spare during the mid-'70s, and instead of letting the reserve trickle out during the rest of the decade, he let it all go with one massive burst.",
